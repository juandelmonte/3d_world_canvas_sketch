This sketch is the result of me trying to learn how 3d graphics work innerly, and couldn't help getting some data in.. it's not optimized at all! ( I built vector and matrix classes to work with, instead of using the native Javascript 'Math' ones.. just revising some linear algebra concepts on the way)

 Got skilled and inspired from the Domestika course 'Creative Coding: Making Visuals with JavaScript'. Link -> https://www.domestika.org/en/courses/2729-creative-coding-making-visuals-with-javascript/course
